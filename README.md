# SwinUNet
A Transformer approach in a UNet architecture. The Swin Unet was introduced in 2021 in : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05537.pdf and their code can be found here : https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/Swin-Unet

The original code was written with PyTorch and we propose here an implementation with Tensorflow.

***Codes comming soon***
