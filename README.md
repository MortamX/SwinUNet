# SwinUNet
A Transformer approach in a UNet architecture 


The Swin Unet was introduced in 2021 in : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05537.pdf (or in https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/Swin-Unet). The original code was written with PyTorch and we propose here an implementation with Tensorflow. This model is inspired by the Swin Transformer released in 2021 through : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14030.pdf


***Codes coming soon***
